=== Adapters

The {opennms-product-name} Provisiond API also supports provisioning adapters (plugins) for integration with external systems during the provisioning import phase.
When node entities are added, updated, deleted, or receive a configuration management change event, {opennms-product-name} will call the adapter for the provisioning activities with integrated systems.

Currently, {opennms-product-name} supports the following adapters:

==== DDNS Adapter

The DDNS adapter uses the dynamic DNS protocol to update a DNS system as nodes are provisioned into {opennms-product-name}.
To configure this adapter, edit the `opennms.properties` file and set the `importer.adapter.dns.server property`:

 importer.adapter.dns.server=192.168.1.1
